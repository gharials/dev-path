# Working with HTTP

There are two basic components in the HTTP protocol: a server and some clients. Clients send requests to a server and the server returns responses. See this [resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_flow) for understanding the request-response flow in detail.

## Fundamental HTTP concepts

The following subsections cover the concepts necessary to get started working with HTTP.

### URLs

URLs are used to identify a web server and access its _resources_. Here is how a URL look like:

`http://www.example.com(1):80(2)/path/to/myfile.html?(3)key1=value1&key2=value2#(4)SomewhereInTheDocument`
{ .annotate }

1. Host name: `www.example.com` (can be an IP address too).
2. Port number: `:80` (optional; assumed to be `80` unless specified otherwise).
3. Query parameter start indicator: `?` (optional; indicates that there are a few query parameters following it in key value format and separated by `&`).
4. Fragment indicator:  `#` (optional; text following it specifies the section in a web page).

URLs cannot contain any spaces. See this [resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI#urls) for further details.

### Requests and responses

Generally, HTTP requests and responses consists of some headers followed by a body. Request and response bodies maybe empty depending on requests or responses.

Here follows a representative example of an HTTP request:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
Accept-Language: fr
```

Here follows a representative example of an HTTP response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 09 Oct 2010 14:28:02 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Tue, 01 Dec 2009 20:18:22 GMT
ETag: "51142bc1-7449-479b075b2891b"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 29769
Content-Type: text/html

<!doctype html>â€¦ (here come the 29769 bytes of the requested web page)
```

### Request methods

Each HTTP request follows a _method_. Notice in the sample request that the first line contains the request method (`GET` in that case). The most commonly used request methods are the following: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

!!! info
    Requests made from the browser address bars are always `GET` requests. Tools like curl or Postman lets you choose the request method.

### Status codes

Each HTTP response contains a status code, indicating the status of the operation---whether the operation succeeded, failed, or anything else. At the same time, status codes also serve as instructions for clients. Notice in the sample response that the first line contains the status code (`200` in that case).

#### The standard status codes

An HTTP server can return any arbitrary number as a status code. There is, however, a standardized list of status codes recognized by all standard clients (e.g., browsers). They are three-digits in length and are organized thematically into classes according to their first digits. Each status code has its own distinct meaning and purpose. See this [resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for an exhaustive list of HTTP status codes with their descriptions.

Among the status classes, `2xx`, `4xx`, and `5xx` appear more frequently in practice. The `2xx` class indicates that the server has successfully processed the request, where `4xx` and `5xx` indicate a failure in processing. Commonly used status codes are `200`, `304`, `404`, `500`, etc.

### Headers

HTTP requests and responses contain a number of _headers._ They follow this general key-value format: `Header-name: value`. Headers may vary per request and response. They serve as metadata or directives (instructions) either for the client or the server. For example, the `Content-Type` header in HTTP responses tells the client how to treat the response body.

!!! info
    An HTTP response sent by a server may contain any kind of data. Then how does a browser understand its format? The `content-type: text/html` header tells browsers that the content is an HTML page and browsers render it. A programmer can fool a browser by sending an HTML page with a different content type, like `content-type: text/plain`. In that case, the browser will not render the page as HTML but will display it as plain text.

### Cookies

A special HTTP header named `Set-Cookie` is called a _cookie._ If a server returns a cookie in a response (e.g., `Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>`), the client stores the cookie value locally. After that, in all subsequent requests to the server, the client includes the locally stored cookie value automatically as the `Cookie` header (e.g., `Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>`). In summary, cookies allow a server to pass some data to clients and get that data back from them each time.

A server forgets about requests and the hosts they came from after returning a response (that is why the HTTP protocol is called _stateless_). A server can never tell from a series of requests it received whether they came from (originate) the same client or not. In other words, servers cannot _identify_ a client. Cookies provide a commonly used means for servers to identify clients: a server sends distinct numbers as cookies to different clients and checks the cookie value in all requests.

Cookies have other useful applications too.
