## Control structures

Usually statements in a program are executed sequentially, one line after another. There are, however, certain statements that can _decide the next statement_ or block of statement to be executed. In other words, they can _control the flow_ of a program. Such statements are collectively known as the _control structures_ of a program.

The common control structures of a programming language are conditionals (e.g., `if-else`, `switch`), loops (e.g., `for`, `while`, `do-while`), and exception handling (`try-catch`).
