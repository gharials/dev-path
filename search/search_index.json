Moreover, a file in a project may go through a long sequence of changes. As the number of files grows in a project, keeping track of their changes becomes increasingly difficult for developers. A version control system (VCS) is an application that keeps track of the changes in files. Git is by far the most popular VCS used by developers, though there are a few more, like Mercurial, Subversion, etc.</p> <p>Git serves two major purposes for developers and teams: history tracking and collaboration. When a developer works on a project for a long time, it is difficult for him/her to memorize the changes the project files have gone through. Git preserves the file histories. It helps developers go through a file's history or the entire repository's history whenever necessary. When a team of developers works together on the same project, there must be some means to keep their work in sync among themselves. Git serves this purpose too.</p> <p>See these pages for a more exhaustive and authoritative treatment of Git.</p>"},{"location":"vcs-git/#basic-git-concepts","title":"Basic Git concepts","text":""},{"location":"vcs-git/#repository","title":"Repository","text":"<p>A directory to be watched for changes by Git is called a repository.

At any instant, we only have the latest state of the directory, but we don't any record of the changes it has gone through. In a Git repository, Git records the changes, and each unit of change recorded by Git is called a commit.</p> <p>While working in a repository, the repository user chooses the changes to be recorded, called staging. After that, the user asks Git to record the staged changes, called committing. Each commit has its automatically generated unique ID. The latest commit is also identified by its alias, <code>HEAD</code>. The sequence of commits of a branch in a repository shows the changes the repository has gone through, known as the commit history of the branch.</p>"},{"location":"vcs-git/#branches","title":"Branches","text":"<p>While working on a project, developers often need to work on a new feature without affecting the existing code. In such situations, without a repository, developers would have to create a copy of the project directory, and start working there. Also, whenever they want to work on the existing code, they would have to switch back to the original directory.</p> <p>Git simplifies this process with branches. A branch is a copy of the repository with its own commit history. You can create new branches and switch between them. Whenever you want to work on a different branch, Git brings the branch copy into your working directory. This is called checking out a branch.</p> <p>Each branch has its own unique name.

So, as GitHub has renamed its default branch name to <code>main</code>, you have a problem when you add a GitHub repository as its remote: when you push to GitHub, changes are pushed to the <code>master</code> branch instead of the <code>main</code> branch.

Still, Git keeps treating them as untracked, causing confusion to developers when they want to check for changes before committing.

Callers of the component pass the variable parts as properties of the <code>props</code> parameter.

Fortunately, browsers and servers together employ caching as a technique to avoid the repeated requests for the same data.</p> <p>In caching, both browser and server have their roles. Browsers cache HTTP responses, which means they store the responses locally. Servers avoid sending data that a client requested earlier unless there are changes to it since the last time; on such occasions, they signal the browser that the requested data has no changes and as a result, browsers reuse the cached data.</p> <p>Let's say that a browser has received some data, say, an image, from a server and cached it as usual. When the browser requests the same data again and the server finds that the data hasn't changed since the client last requested it, the server doesn't send the data again. Instead, the server returns a response with status code 304 (not modified) and without a body, resulting in a smaller response size.</p> <p>The status code 304 tells the client that it may use its cached version of the data as it hasn't changed on the server. On the other hand, if the server detects that the data has changed, it returns a usual response with status code <code>200</code> (OK) and the data included in the response body.
